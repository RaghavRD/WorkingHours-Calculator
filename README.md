## WorkingHours Calculator
The Working Hour Calculator is a tool designed to help users track their weekly working hours based on the number of days worked and off days. Inspired by discussions around the Factory Act, which mandates a 48-hour workweek, this project allows employees to efficiently calculate their remaining hours and ensure they're on track to meet their work-hour goals.


## Key Features
- Input the number of worked days and off days.
- Automatically calculates total working hours based on the 48-hour workweek.
- Converts hours from HH
- format to decimal for precise calculations.
- Provides feedback on remaining hours to meet the weekly goal.
- Suggests daily hours needed for remaining workdays based on input.
- Light/Dark theme switch for a customizable user experience.

  
## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **CustomTkinter:** For building the modern graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Tkinter:** For additional UI components.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I learned how to implement time tracking mechanisms in a user-friendly interface and how to handle date and time calculations using Python. The project also strengthened my skills in building responsive, modern UIs using the CustomTkinter library.
